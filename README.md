# Facial Data and Pose Generation
In this project, I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive pipeline aimed at enhancing facial data processing and image generation using cutting-edge deep learning models.
Designed and implemented a robust pipeline to integrate facial data into the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model. This involved meticulous calibration to ensure the model effectively learns and adapts to the unique facial characteristics of each individual.
Constructed a sophisticated pipeline capable of generating images with the subject's face accurately posed according to given reference poses.
Integrated an advanced upscaling model into the existing pipeline to elevate the quality of generated images. Conducted extensive experimentation with various samplers within the framework to optimize image quality and sampling speed. Evaluated and compared the performance of different samplers based on the quality of images produced and the efficiency of the sampling process.
